                <p>
                    I love to cook, but I haven’t always. <br>In fact, for most of my early adult life,cooking
                    dinner
                    usually meant <br>microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something <br>that came
                    from a
                    box. It wasn’t until I got married that I started <br>eating real food because I married a guy
                    who
                    cooks. I
                    started joining <br>him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun

            <p>I love cooking for myself and family. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining confidence as a home
                chef? That was life changing!If you tried one of my recipes or techniques and loved it (or even if you
                didn’t), let me know. Also, feel free to share any of my recipes, posts or photos, but just be sure to
                credit my blog and mention that you found it here first. I do my best to give credit to my sources as
                well. It’s just good food karma.</p>
